## About This Repo

This repository is a follow-along companion to
the book <u>Deep Learning for the Life Sciences</u>,
by Bharath Ramsundar et al (published by O'Reilly).

This repository will not refrain from, ahem,
polite commentary on the book's instructions 
and coverage of relevant material.

## Installing

Your options are:

* <s>Install using DeepChem website's instructions</s> (does not include all necessary conda channels)
* <s>Install using instructions in Readme</s> (cose but no cigar, problems with python version)
* <s>Install using instructions in Readme, but specifying Python version</s> (fails with other things...)
* <s>Use Docker</s> (only works if you have a CPU, not mentioned on DeepChem website)
* [Use Binder](Binder.md) (caveat: don't lose your browser window, or all your hard work, or at the very least your nice Jupyter notebook, will disappear forever into the bindether.)
* [Use Vagrant](Vagrant.md) (A DeepChem install option that actually works. Requires a fresh Ubuntu 16.04 image.)

**Note:** You could also use a cloud compute node, 
which you'll end up doing anyway, 
since a virtual machine will be pathetically 
underpowered for machine learning tasks.
