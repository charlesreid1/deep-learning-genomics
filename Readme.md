# Deep Learning for Genomics

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks and notes for 
deep learning for genomics.

Originally this was going to be book notes for the
O'Reilly book <u>Deep Learning for the Life Sciences</u>
by Ramsundar et al (O'Reilly). However, the book was
so terrible that we've abandoned any attempt at working
through the book's examples or using DeepChem.
