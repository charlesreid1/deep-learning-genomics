# Deep Learning for Genomics

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks and notes for 
deep learning for genomics.

Originally this was going to be book notes for the
O'Reilly book "Deep Learning for the Life Sciences"
by Ramsundar et al (O'Reilly). However, the book was
so terrible that we have abandoned any attempt at working
through the book's examples or using DeepChem.
