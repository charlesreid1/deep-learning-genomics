# Installing DeepChem on Google Colaboratory

Google Colaboratory is a compute platform
for running Jupyter notebooks in the cloud.
It provides a Python runtime plus a GPU.

Make sure you select the Python 3 + GPU runtime
before running DeepChem in the notebook!

There is a fully working Google Colaboratory
notebook that is set up with instructions to
install DeepChem here: <https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1kvt3ctlbZnL75uGcZiSnSl82fT3GHnKx>

That's it.
